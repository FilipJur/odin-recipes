<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>Onion burgers are one of America's greatest regional renditions, but be warned--these are diner style!</p>
<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Two tablespoons salted butter</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>1 large onion, very thinly sliced</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon granulated garlic</li>
    <li>1 pound 85% lean ground beef</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon Hamburger Seasoning</li>
    <li>½ cup sliced portobello mushrooms</li>
    <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>4 slices Swiss cheese</li>
    <li>4 rolls rolls, hamburger, white, enriched, plain</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Heat a skillet over medium heat. Add butter and oil; heat until butter is melted. Add onion and garlic. Cook until onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Heat a large skillet or flat-top over medium-high heat for a few minutes. Place patties into the hot skillet and smash with a spatula or bacon press. Hold patties down for 30 seconds, then cover each patty with some of the cooked onion. Cook for 2 minutes. Carefully flip burgers, making sure to scrape the browned bits off the skillet.</li>
    <li>Season patties with salt and pepper and place a slice of cheese on each. Cook until burgers have reached the desired doneness, 2 to 4 minutes more. Top each patty with leftover onion and mushrooms and serve on buns.</li>
